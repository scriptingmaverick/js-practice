# Repeated Substring Pattern
Given a string s, check if it can be constructed by taking a substring of it and appending multiple copies of the substring together.

## Examples:
### Example 1:
```js
Input: s = "abab"
Output: true
Explanation: It is the substring "ab" twice.
```

### Example 2:
```js
Input: s = "aba"
Output: false
```

### Example 3:
```js
Input: s = "abcabcabcabc"
Output: true
Explanation: It is the substring "abc" four times or the substring "abcabc" twice.
